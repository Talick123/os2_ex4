This program receives a directory in the argument vector. The program
then proceeds to scan the contents of the directory. If it encounters
an executable file, it will as the user if they would like to delete the file.
If so the program deletes the file from the current directory. If the
program encounters a subdirectory, it will then recursively scan the contents
of the subdirectory until it reaches the end of the tree.

Compile: gcc -Wall ex4b.c -o ex4b

Run:    ./ex4b <directory_name>

Input: yes or no to whether the user would like to delete the file
    ex: "Would you like to delete file: <file_name> Y/N?" y
        (following inputs are allowed : Y/y/N/n)

Output: number of bytes deleted from disk
    ex: Number of bytes deleted from disk: 56666
